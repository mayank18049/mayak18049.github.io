Hi
I am Mayank Rawat, Undergrad@IIITD pursuing Computer Science and Engineering since 2018. I am working with Dr Rinku Shah on Scalable and Reconfigurable in-network cryptography using microservice concepts. I am currently working on integrating FPGA-based design with Programmable DataPlanes like SmartNICs. I have also worked for 6 months in Ericsson Research as an Intern with Dr Najangud Narendra for Microservice Migration and Traffic Shifting in the 5G ecosystem. 

I am interested in broad topics of Programmable Data Planes, Reconfigurable Hardware-Software Codesign, Computer Networks and Operating Systems. Hardware is the new software :)

In my free time, I enjoy running from running; besides that, I love cycling, rock climbing and building and tinkering with computers.
